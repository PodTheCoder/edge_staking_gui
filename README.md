## Frequently Asked Questions
Q: How does the GUI improve security?

A: The GUI improves security compared to the traditional approach by implementing the *device token* staking method. The major benefit of this method is that the GUI has no access to your wallet. Furthermore, the official Edge software is used under the hood and the software is open source.

Q: How can I switch networks?

A: Network switching is an advanced feature. 

- If a stake is already setup, first click the button `Back To Setup.` 

- Stop the program (make sure it does not run minimized). 

- Then change your config.txt to: `network = 'testnet'` or `network = 'mainnet'`

- Restart the program & follow the steps in the GUI.

Q: My installer says the app/developer is unrecognized. Eg. Running the .msi installer I get the error: Microsoft Defender SmartScreen prevented an unrecognised app from starting.

A: This is expected because the Edge Staking GUI is a new program and does not yet have code signing. To continue on Microsoft Defender Smartscreen, click on "More info -> Run anyway". On MacOS you might also need to explicitly choose to trust the unidentified developer.

Q: Help I am stuck. Where can I get support?

A: On the Edge Discord: https://ed.ge/discord. Ask in the *staking-support* channel.
