## Frequently Asked Questions
Q: Does the GUI have access to my wallet?

A: No. The GUI is designed to use the *device code* staking method.

Q: How can I switch networks?

A: Click "Network" in the bottom-right of the GUI.

Q: When running the .msi installer I get the error: Microsoft Defender SmartScreen prevented an unrecognised app from starting.

A: This is expected because the Edge Staking GUI is a new program. To continue, click on "More info -> Run anyway"

Q: Help I am stuck. Where can I get support?

A: On the Edge Discord: https://ed.ge/discord. Ask in the *staking-support* channel.
