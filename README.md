In alpha. Step 1 and 2 are tested on Windows 10. The other remaining steps are still in development.

## Design Goals
- Minimal configuration, set it and forget it.
- Donâ€™t integrate wallet functionality into the GUI. The web Edge wallet already does that well. All a node needs is a stake. When correctly configured, version 1 of the Edge Staking GUI aims to have NO access to the wallet where your XE is held.

## Features
- Simple to use.
- Check system requirements and automatically install the correct Edge CLI for your system.
- Run on any Operating System with initial focus on Windows.

## Nerd Info
- Tauri framework for Cross-OS Desktop App.
- Frontend -> Vue with Vite.
- Backend -> Rust.
