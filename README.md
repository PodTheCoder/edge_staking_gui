# Unofficial Edge Staking GUI

In alpha. Step 1 and 2 are tested on Windows 10. The other remaining steps are still in development.

## Design Goals
- Easy to use.
- Minimal configuration.
- No administrator permissions required.
- Run on Windows, Mac or Linux. Initial focus on Windows.
- Donâ€™t integrate wallet functionality into the GUI. The web Edge wallet already does that well. All a node needs is a stake. When correctly configured, version 1 of the Edge Staking GUI aims to have NO access to the wallet where your XE is held.

## Implemented Features
- Check if your system is ready for staking.
- Automatically intall the correct Edge CLI for your system.
- Start & Stop staking.
- Display current status & log for troubleshooting.

## Planned Features Ver 1.0
- Set up staking using only your device code.
- Check if your device is online.

## Planned Features Ver 1.5
- Auto-launch application when your system starts.
- Minimize application to tray.

## Nerd Info
- Tauri framework for Cross-OS Desktop App.
- Frontend -> Vue with Vite.
- Backend -> Rust.
- Creates correct Edge CLI URL based on requirements & checks checksum.
